> [!NOTE]
> **A message from the developer**
>
> Hey everyone 👋 I'm Aditya, the developer behind Echo Music. I started this project just for fun while managing my studies, never expecting it to grow this much. Seeing the support and love from the community has been incredible — truly beyond what I imagined.
>
> However, maintaining and scaling this project has become difficult to balance alongside my academics. Because of this, I've decided to **publicly archive Echo Music**. The source code will remain open for anyone to explore, fork, or build upon.
>
> Thank you for every star, every kind word, and every contribution. It meant everything. Take care — bye.
